Biology is the scientific study of life and all living organisms. It examines how living things are structured, how they function, how they grow and develop, and how they interact with one another and with their environment. Biology also explores how different species evolved over millions of years and how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring through genetics.

Biology covers a wide range of fields. Cell biology studies the basic unit of life—the cell. Molecular biology focuses on the molecules that make life possible, such as DNA and proteins. Genetics explains how traits are inherited and why individuals within a species vary. Ecology studies how organisms interact with each other and with their physical surroundings. Zoology examines animals, while botany focuses on plants. Microbiology studies microscopic organisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Biology also investigates the processes that keep organisms alive, such as respiration, reproduction, digestion, and circulation. It explains how the human body works, how plants produce food through photosynthesis, how diseases spread, and how ecosystems remain balanced.

Overall, biology helps us understand the natural world, improve human health, protect the environment, and make scientific advancements that benefit society. It is a foundational science that connects to medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, environmental science, and many other fields.
